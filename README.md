# Profile-Page-Using-CSS-Box-Model

 Project Overview

The **Personal Profile Website** is a simple static web project created using **HTML5** and **CSS3**. This project is designed to help beginners understand the basic structure of a webpage, the use of semantic HTML elements, and the application of CSS styling concepts such as cascading, box model, and layout design. The website presents personal information such as name, education, skills, and contact details in a clean and organized format.

This project is ideal for students who are starting their journey in **web development** and want to practice building real-world webpages using foundational technologies.
